# Superpy.py

Please include a short, 300-word report that highlights three technical elements of your implementation that you find notable, explain what problem they solve and why you chose to implement it in this way. Include this in your repository as a report.md file.


* ## Highlight 1): Date calculation
To make calculations with dates is difficult in Python. You do need the Datetime library to convert ASCII dates into date objects. This way you can make calculations with dates in an easy way. So first convert dates into dates objects before doing any calculations.

* ## Highlight 2): Parameter check
When enetering routines, parameters are required. If you are missing parameters or having parameters in the wrong format, the program ends with an error. When entering a routine, I check f the right parameters are given and if dates are in the right format. If not, a decent message is displayed.
